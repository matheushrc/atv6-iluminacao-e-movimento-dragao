# AGENTS

For every change requested by the user, the agent must run the server using the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And check the browser logs for any errors or issues, and if the requested change is reflected in the application. To do this effectively, the agent should open the browser at the address provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`) using Playwright MCP.
